# Simple-Linear-Regression-

Simple linear regression model is a statistical model that analyzes the relationship between an independent variable and a single dependent variable. It predicts the results by finding a linear relationship between the two variables through a straight line.

### Why use it:
- To understand or predict what the result will be with a feature.
- To determine the numerical correlation between the two variables.

*Application and use cases:*
1. Estimating the price of a house based on its size.
2. Analyzing the effect of advertising on sales revenue.
3. Understanding the relationship between a student's study hours and his marks.
4. Knowing the relationship between rainfall and crop production in agriculture.

### Mathematical and Statistical Formula of Simple Linear Regression

1. *Model Equation:*
y = a + bx
(y = dependent variable, x = independent variable, a = y-intercept, b = slope)

2. *Slope (b) Calculation:*
b = [n∑(xy) - ∑x ∑y] / [n∑(x²) - (∑x)²]

3. *Intercept (a) Calculation:*
a = [∑y ∑(x²) - ∑x ∑(xy)] / [n∑(x²) - (∑x)²]

4. *Predict the value of the regression line:*
ŷ = a + bx

5. *R² (Coefficient of Determination):* To understand the explanatory power of the model.

6. *Residual Sum of Squares (RSS):* Σ(y - ŷ)², where y is the actual value, ŷ is the prediction.
